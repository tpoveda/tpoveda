I am **Tomas Poveda**, Technical Artist specialized in character and pipeline technology with a strong programming background that works in the Videogame and Animation industry. Always looking to make artists' life easier. DCC lover :heart:.

My experience and background allowed me to develop a profile that combines both technical and artistic skills. I love listening and helping my teammates, so they can focus on art rather than the technology to create it.

I am really interested in the followin topics: DCC agnostic development, Character rigging, Machine Learning, ...

<hr>

During my spare time I love to invest my time in developing custom tools and frameworks. Here are some of my developments:


### tpDcc

</p>

DCC agnostic framework that allows the creation of tools that can work under any DCC that supports Python.

* Python 2 and 3 support
* Reroute DCC agnostic layer
* Generic DCC objects
* Inheritance based configuration files system. Your tools can use different configurations based on which DCC you are working on.
* Generic DCC agnostic TCP client/server implementation. Launch your tool outisde your DCC.
* Huge collection of Qt widgets. Your tools will look similar no matter which DCC are your workign on.
* Complete Qt style/theme manager.
* And much more ...

### tpRigToolkit
